<h2>functionalProgramming</h2>

1. Understand Functional Programming Terminology
2. Understand the Hazards of Using Imperative Code
3. Avoid Mutations and Side Effects Using Functional Programming
4. Pass Arguments to Avoid External Dependence in a Function
5. Refactor Global Variables Out of Functions
6.Use the map Method to Extract Data from an Array
7. Implement map on a Prototype
8. Use the filter Method to Extract Data from an Array - Array.prototype.filter()
9. Implement the filter Method on a Prototype
10. Return Part of an Array Using the slice Method
